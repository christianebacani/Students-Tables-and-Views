# SQL Learning Projects

This repository contains SQL scripts I created as part of my learning path on DataCamp's Introduction to SQL course in the Data Engineering track. The purpose of these scripts is to apply and demonstrate the SQL concepts and keywords I have learned, including stored procedures, views, and the usage of `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT` keywords.

## Repository Structure

- `Stored Procedure.sql`: Contains the SQL script to create and execute stored procedures.
- `Student Tables and Views.sql`: Contains the SQL script to create student-related tables and views, and demonstrate the use of `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT` keywords.

## Learning Path

As part of my structured learning path, I create and apply what I have learned from each course. This repository reflects my progress and understanding of key SQL concepts.

### Stored Procedures

A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. They are used to encapsulate logic for reusability and maintainability. In the `Stored Procedure.sql` file, you will find examples of creating and using stored procedures.

### Views

A view is a virtual table that provides a way to simplify complex queries, enhance security, and encapsulate business logic. In the `Student Tables and Views.sql` file, you will find examples of creating views on student-related data.

### DISTINCT Keyword

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to return only distinct (different) values in a result set. This is useful when you want to eliminate duplicate values from your results. Examples of using the `DISTINCT` keyword can be found in the `Student Tables and Views.sql` file.

### LIMIT Keyword

The `LIMIT` keyword is used to limit the number of rows returned in a query result. This is useful for paging through results or retrieving a subset of data. Examples of using the `LIMIT` keyword can be found in the `Student Tables and Views.sql` file.

## Usage

To run the SQL scripts, follow these steps:

1. Open your SQL database client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, etc.).
2. Load the script file you want to execute.
3. Execute the script to create and interact with the database objects.

## Conclusion

This repository is part of my continuous learning journey in data engineering. By committing these scripts to GitHub, I aim to document my progress and provide a reference for others who are also learning SQL. Feel free to explore the scripts and provide any feedback or suggestions.
